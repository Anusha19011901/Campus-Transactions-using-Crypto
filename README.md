# Campus-Transactions-using-Crypto
This project aims to use a technology that develops our very own custom implementation of a blockchain in order to create our very own cryptocurrency
In our project we aim to create a personalized transaction system for the campus using cryptocurrency. The novelty is that in our system, server issues will be minimal, and problems can be addressed quicker than that of normal transaction platforms like gpay. Cryptocurrency transactions are also person to person, like physical cash, unlike online credit transactions that required an intermediary. This makes it more trustworthy and secure. This is even more secure than digital currency due to its encryption properties.
The cryptocurrency is independent of all centralized control and is built on a decentralized structure. But every transaction is documented in a publicly accessible decentralized ledger.
